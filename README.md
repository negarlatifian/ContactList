# JavaScript React Native - Testing the Contact List

## A. Scenario

The contact list application works beautifully and the sales team buys you cake. However, during the cake-celebration-event you also get a few bug reports... turns out that the application is not behaving as expected, all of the times. Things are sometimes missing and not showing up as expected.

Tests... you are missing tests.

## B. What you will be working on today

Today we will add tests to the application that we wrote yesterday; the contact list application. We will add tests for the three levels in the testing pyramid; unit, component and end-to-end tests.

## C. Testing and linting setup

### Linting

Set up the project to use ESLint with the [Here's](https://github.com/saltsthlm/salt-linting-demo) an instruction repo on how to use linters.

### Testing

Well, that's is the task of the day.

## D. Lab instructions

We want you to add:

* a few unit tests that tests individual functions
* a few component tests using [React Testing Library](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) to verify user interaction
* one end-to-end (e2e) test that verifies that all of it goes together.

Good luck and have fun!
